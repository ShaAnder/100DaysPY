# 100DaysPY

## Introduction

Repository for the 100 days of python course.

Originally I was going to use this repository as one element of my portfolio, to showcase the completed projects and as a stepping stone, to becoming a developer, I have however decided to expand on the scope of this repository to showcase the skills and creativity i've picked up along the way. 

The new goal of this repository is to creat a before / after image of each days project. Each course day folder will contain:<br>
    ```
    -> A Project folder
    ```<br>
    ```
    -> An overengineered folder
    ```
    
The aim is to complete the base project to the standard the course required, and then have a seperate folder for each day, to showcase how close to a working application i can bring each project, using only python and it's built in tools.

I have also for the longer programs decided to add in a basic flow chart for visual clarity on how the program works.
