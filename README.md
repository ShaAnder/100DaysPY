# 100DaysPY

## Introduction

Repository for the 100 days of python course.

This is a repository showcasing the 100 days of python projects, all completed and able to work with the packages in requirements.txt or any env files. 

Originally I had planned to make this a two fold repository, partially to show off the completed projects and secondarily to show off over engineered examples or close to app examples.
However I have decided to move the overenginnered / app examples to different repositories, as some just wouldn't make good apps on their own and it would be better to give them a dedicated space.

## NOTES

- For longer projects I have decided to add a flowchart 
- Days 41-44 are going to be HTML CSS AND JS, the projects that follow involve web dev and scraping so having an understanding of these languages is a must
