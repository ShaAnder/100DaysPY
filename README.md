# 100DaysPY

## Introduction

Repository for the 100 days of python course.

This is a repository showcasing the 100 days of python projects, all completed and able to work with the packages in requirements.txt or any env files. 

Originally I had planned to make this a two fold repository, partially to show off the completed projects and secondarily to show off over engineered examples or close to app examples.
However I have decided to move the overenginnered / app examples to different repositories, as some just wouldn't make good apps on their own and it would be better to give them a dedicated space.

## NOTES

- AS this repository is a directory of all the work in the course, and id rather not create a thing for every single day, it's recommended to check out 
the [Refinded Github](https://github.com/refined-github/refined-github) extension, as it has an integrated single directory downloader

- For longer projects I have decided to add a flowchart 

- Days 41-44 are going to be HTML CSS AND JS, the projects that follow involve web dev and scraping so having an understanding of these languages is a must

- For days 54 onward we will be moving to a web dev environment with flask, django is also being learnt in a seperate course we will revisit a lot of projects
from previous days and look to rebuild them with django in mind

- The Final 19 Days of this course are all professional portfolio projects, designed from the ground up to be my step into the working world. As such I will not include these in this repository, but their own one. There will be links in each folder to navigate to said projects.
