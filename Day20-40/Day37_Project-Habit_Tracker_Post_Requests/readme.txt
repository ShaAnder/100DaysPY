### --- PROJECT NAME / DESC --- ###

Habit Tracker Project, this is a small project designed with the idea of tracking habit progress, it uses a bar process similar to gits commit timeline. The more done the more prominent
the colour represented during the day

### --- PARAMETERS --- ###

The program must be able to connect to and create a pixela account using requests as it's not a standard login / create.
The program must then be able to create a graph using a request
Finally using requests the graph should be able to create a new update

NOTE, for testing you need a .env file with the following parameters filled in.

USER="YOURUSERNAME"
TOKEN="YOURPW"

unlike other api apps we actually enter our own here as it's created upon first sending the request

### --- HOW IT WORKS --- ###

Most of the codes is commented out as you only need to use it once, but it's beneficial to keep in the file for creating new graphs ect
This program works by making a series of one of requests to creat the account and graph, then to update said graph whenever we enter the information

### --- TO DO / FUTURE PLANS --- ### 

This is a great addition to any form of hobby / workout tracker, and can be seen in a lot of places, for example github, on aimlabs and more
