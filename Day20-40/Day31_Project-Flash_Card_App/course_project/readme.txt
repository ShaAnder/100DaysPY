### --- CAPSTONE PROJECT --- ###

This capstone project (flash card app) uses what we have learnt about tkinter and data reading to create
a flash card app that teaches french words.

### --- PARAMETERS --- ###

The app needs to have the following

- The ability to cycle through random words and apply them to a card
- The ability to see the english version of a word when the card was flipped
- A timed flip that resets after a new card is drawn
- The ability to save all non learnt words so that when the app is rerun it can continue where it left off
