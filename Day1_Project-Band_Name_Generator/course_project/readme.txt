###--- Description---###

A small starting project that will generate a band name based on user input

###---PARAMETERS---###

1. Create a greeting for your program.

2. Ask the user for the city that they grew up in.

3. Ask the user for the name of a pet.

4. Combine the name of their city and pet and show them their band name.

5. Make sure the input cursor shows on a new line

###---WHAT WE NEED---###

Nothing in specific 

###---IMPROVEMENTS---###

This would be exceedingly simple to make into an app, but we would need some slight IMPROVEMENTS

- UI
- Save names feature (probably require a login option and database)
- Create your own (the base version) or choose from a range of topics
- More than two words

###---APP POTENTIAL---###

Yes

Name generators are always popular, for pretty much everything from band names to gamertag names even childrens names
and fantasy names.
