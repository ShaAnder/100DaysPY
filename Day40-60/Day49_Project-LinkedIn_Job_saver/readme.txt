### --- PROJECT NAME / DESC --- ###

Linked in job saver selenium script, originally this was supposed to be a job searcher but as i was using my main linked in profile at the time, I figured saving the jobs would be 
more friendly, and means I wouldn't accidently apply to 100 jobs i'm not currently looking for

### --- PARAMETERS --- ###

Must be able to log into your linked in account
search for jobs under a specified query
using the parameters set apply for jobs with the easy apply function (that only asks for one field)

### --- HOW IT WORKS --- ###

The bot will take my login and mobile information saved in the env file to log into my account, it will then direct itself to the link 
provided and start saving jobs for future viewing, to prevent it spamming an entire list i cliced the list to do only the first 5 jobs

### --- REQUIREMENTS --- ###



### --- TO DO / FUTURE PLANS --- ### 

This isn't really much of anything i can do for an application process, as a whole complex work with selenium can be great for 
automation but i wouldn't make a bot to apply for jobs automatically as id want to tailor it on a per job basis.
