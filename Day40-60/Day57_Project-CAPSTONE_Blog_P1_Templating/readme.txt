### --- PROJECT NAME / DESC --- ###

The first part of our blog capstone project using templating with jinja and flask to build a blog website

### --- PARAMETERS --- ###

The program must be able to take templated html and css from jinja and serve them using a flask server to the internt

### --- HOW IT WORKS --- ###

We take our html / css files and feed them into the flask server and if all goes as expected when we navigate to the url we should have access to our 
own website with a name card build and ran on flask

### --- REQUIREMENTS --- ###

Only real requirement is flask and jinja

### --- TO DO / FUTURE PLANS --- ### 

Building on what we were learning from static html serving this time we are now looking at templated html, while a blog isn't
something i'd build a website over it can definitely be something to add to one maybe as a page or something
