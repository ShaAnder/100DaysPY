### --- PROJECT NAME / DESC --- ###

Selenium automatic game player bot - a simple selenium script to automate and play the browser game cookie clicker

### --- PARAMETERS --- ###

Must be able to click the cookie
Buy store items
Stop itself after a certain time period


### --- HOW IT WORKS --- ###

Using slenium to find the various elements in a webpage the script loops through and finds what it needs and stores it in lists, it then proceeds to click the cookie to gain currency.
instead of writing a huge block of code to figure out costs between each items and tally money I found an easier and more efficient solution in that it just checks the items available,
from expensive to cheap and then tries to buy them

### --- TO DO / FUTURE PLANS --- ### 

On it's own not much selenium is a powerful tool however and automation is an interesting field, building a fully working standalone bot for an app seems like an interesting and fun prospect
for the future
