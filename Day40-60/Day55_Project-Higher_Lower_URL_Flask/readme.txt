### --- PROJECT NAME / DESC --- ###

Higher Lower Game In Flask /w urls, this is a simple guess the number game similar to what we did back in Day 12, 
but instead of using the console we use Flask Python and HTML to create it in the web browser

### --- PARAMETERS --- ###

game must be able to accept an input in the browser bar for checking
and must be able to provide feedback on if the input is correct or incorrect
finally must be able to provide feedback if the user puts in something not in the scope of the game

### --- HOW IT WORKS --- ###

The user puts their guess into the browser hotbar and it checks it vs the chosen random number
it then navigates to a page based on if it is correct or incorrect 

### --- REQUIREMENTS --- ###

Only real requirement is flask

### --- TO DO / FUTURE PLANS --- ### 

Flask and webdev is a very powerful skillset to have and something i'll be deepdiving, this specific project COULD be tooled into something more fun in the FUTURE
but core aim of the lesson (urls and advanced decorators) isn't a very practical way to play a game
