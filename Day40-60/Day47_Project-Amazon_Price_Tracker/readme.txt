### --- PROJECT NAME / DESC --- ###

Amazon price tracker checks the prices so you don't have to

### --- PARAMETERS --- ###

Must be able to check the price on the website
Must be able to then compare that to the chosen price
if a match is found must be able to send an email


### --- HOW IT WORKS --- ###

The program scrapes the price from amazons page and compares it to the chosen price, if a match is found sends an email to the user. I created a email sender class for this one
to prevent me having to write the code over and over again, it can be located in a toolkit folder i've included in the main cwd

### --- TO DO / FUTURE PLANS --- ### 

NONE, at least none using scraping, price checkers are a valuable tool and developing one using legal means is a very interesting prospect. This was purely a project for the course
to get a functional understanding of how scraping and BS4 works
