### --- IMPORTS --- ###

#we want random to create a random word
import random
#we want to get the stages and log in from the art and the words in for the words
from hangman_art import stages, logo
from hangman_words import word_list
#for our clear func
from os import system, name
#for timing
import time

### --- VARIABLES --- ###

#We want to set a while loop conditional for later
end_of_game = False
#Select a random word from the word list
chosen_word = random.choice(word_list)
#Get the length of our chosen word for later
word_length = len(chosen_word)

#this will keep track of our lives
lives = 6
#WE add our guessed letters here to enable us to cross check later
letters_guessed = []

#print the logo :)
print(logo)

### --- TESTING --- ###

#print(f'The word is: {chosen_word}.')

### --- FUNCTIONS --- ###

#having the ability to clear the code with this function makes for a better user experience
