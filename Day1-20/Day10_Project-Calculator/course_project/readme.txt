Project 10 - Basic Operations Calculator

###--- PROJECT OBJECTIVES ---###

Todays project is a small functioning calculator 

- The calculator should have the functional ability to + - / *
- Once the user has chosen the operation it should carry out the maths
- After this the calculator should be able to continue going
- If the user wants to continue doing equations it will continue allowing user
  to add to the already created number 
- If not the calculator will finish, and clear for future use

We will use an art file for the header and then the rest of the code will be in the
main file

Flow chart of events:

START
    ASK THE USER THEIR FIRST NUMBER

        ASK THE USER THE OPERATION

            ASK USERS SECOND NUMBER

                CALCULATE THE ANSWER

                    ASK USER TO GO AGAIN

                        IF YES:

                            STORE ANSWER FOR FUTURE MANIPULATION

                        IF NO:

                            CLEAR FOR NEW EQUATION / END USE
