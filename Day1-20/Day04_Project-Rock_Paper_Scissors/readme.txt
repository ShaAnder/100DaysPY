### --- HOW IT WORKS --- ###

The user can choose one of three options 0,1,2 (labelled)
The computer randomly chooses one toolkit
After this the game plays out by the use of if/else statements
and then resolved based on ruling conditions

### --- TO DO / FUTURE PLANS --- ### 

Could easily be turned into a small app / or part of a minigames app
in the future python probably is not the best to use for it however
