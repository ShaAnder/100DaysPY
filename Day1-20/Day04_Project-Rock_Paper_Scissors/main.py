#first we want to take our ascii art and put them into a list

#then we want to create a list of all possible user choices

#next we want to ask the user what to pick 
user_choice = int(input("Please enter A number 0:Rock, 1:Paper, 2:Scissors, take note no other numbers will work:"))

#now for our first conditional, we want to make sure what the user picked was valid

    #now that both player and cpu have picked we compare

    #The best way to figure out who won is by greater than / less than, then in the case of one picking rock vs one picking scissors we can
    #do a specific condition for that. So we need: draw, 1 vs 2, 2 vs 3 and finally 1 vs 3

    #first the draw condition:

    #next we want to code up the rock vs scissor condition, thought scissor is a greater number on the list than rock it SHOULD lose.
    #user gets scissors and cpu gets rock
